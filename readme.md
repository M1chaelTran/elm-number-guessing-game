# My very first game written in ELM
### The game
Think of a number, the game will try and guess it.

You then tell it whether the number you have in mind is 'Lower' or 'Higher' than the number it has given you.

### Start the game
- Clone it and `cd` into it
- `elm-reactor` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/main.elm`
- Play the game

### Nice to have
- Make it look nicer
- Have stats to show win/lost
- A better algorithms for guessing number
